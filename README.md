## Pygame-ebook

### Overview:

This is an ePub production of Al Sweigart's games programming book *Making Games with Python & Pygame* at (https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/).

### E-book:

I have provided an ePub and the code needed to recreate it, feel free to use the code for your own projects as per the licenses stated below.

The e-book currently passes [epubcheck 4.0.2](https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck) with `No errors or warnings detected.` and looks pretty good in Google Books, iBooks and Adobe Digital Editions. However the images need consistent borders, so at some point I'll re-crop them.

#### Compiling:

A new ePub file can be made by using the provided `CreateE-book.py` via installing [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and then running the script on IDLE, [Thonny](http://thonny.org/) or the `python3 CreateE-book.py` command on the macOS/GNU-Linux Terminal. The script however **does not** work with Python 2 and I have no plans to backport.

XHTML, CSS and the `metadata.json` files can be edited using a text editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

The `toc.ncx` and `content.opf` are generated by the `CreateE-book.py` and shouldn't be edited as they would be overwritten.
