## Pygame-ebook

### Overview:

This is an ePub production of Al Sweigart's games programming book *Making Games with Python & Pygame* at (https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/), the only freely available ePub of the book to my knowledge. This isn't merely a copy of the source PDF and HTML, there are a few tweaks:

* New cover [PLANNED] - There's going to be a new cover that has the spirit of the original, but to my taste and at a larger resolution.
* Licenses page - There's a new license page that clearly lays out the book's licenses, as standard in all my sample book productions.
* HTTPS links - All links direct to sites by using HTTPS unless the sites don't support it.
* Better resolution XKCD comic - Used the original from the site and included a link back to XKCD and the tooltip caption.
* New screenshots for operating systems in Chapter 1 - A lot has changed since 2012 and this e-book uses good resolution screenshots of the latest versions of Windows, macOS and Ubuntu. I may also include Raspbian with PIXEL too.
* Added instructions in Chapter 1 - I have added an alternate way to start IDLE using Spotlight and plan to add more instructions to make the book more useful, such as information on the Raspberry Pi.

Of course, you can suggest further tweaks. Go to the Issues tab and ask away. :-)

### E-book:

I have provided an ePub and the code needed to recreate it, feel free to use the code for your own projects as per the licenses stated below.

The e-book currently passes [epubcheck 4.0.2](https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck) with `No errors or warnings detected.` and looks pretty good in Google Books, iBooks and Adobe Digital Editions. However the images need consistent borders, so at some point I'll re-crop them.

#### Compiling:

A new ePub file can be made by using the provided `CreateE-book.py` via installing [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and then running the script on IDLE, [Thonny](http://thonny.org/) or the `python3 CreateE-book.py` command on the macOS/GNU-Linux Terminal. The script however **does not** work with Python 2 and I have no plans to backport.

XHTML, CSS and the `metadata.json` files can be edited using a text editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

The `toc.ncx` and `content.opf` are generated by the `CreateE-book.py` and shouldn't be edited as they would be overwritten.
